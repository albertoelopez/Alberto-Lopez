The haters gonna hate, hate, hate
But I'm a player gonna play, play, play

This is our song, our moment
Shake it off and just move on

In New York, New York so grand
Where ambition meets the sky
This concrete paradise, my homeland

Memories of you still linger here
But morning light brings hope so clear
Time to write a brand new chapter

Tonight we party like it's 1999
Young and wild and free to be
