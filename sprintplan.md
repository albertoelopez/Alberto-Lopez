## Risk Mitigation

### High Priority Risks
1. **Gemini API Rate Limits**
   - Mitigation: Implement request batching and caching
   - Fallback: Use local similarity algorithms

2. **Database Size Limitations**
   - Mitigation: Focus on 50-100 popular songs for demo
   - Use compressed lyric representations

3. **Complex Legal Analysis**
   - Mitigation: Simplify to basic similarity detection
   - Clear disclaimers about legal advice limitations

### Technical Debt Decisions
- Skip user authentication for MVP
- Use in-memory storage instead of persistent database
- Simplified UI focusing on core functionality
- Basic error handling for demo purposes

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Complete agentic AI workflow (planner → executor → memory)
- [ ] Gemini API successfully integrated
- [ ] Demonstrates clear copyright similarity detection
- [ ] Provides useful alternative suggestions
- [ ] Professional demo video recorded
- [ ] All documentation complete
- [ ] Submission completed before deadline

## Demo Script Timeline
- **00:00-00:30**: Introduction and problem statement
- **00:30-01:30**: User inputs potentially infringing lyrics, show planning phase
- **01:30-02:30**: Show executor calling Gemini API, similarity detection
- **02:30-03:30**: Display results with alternatives, show memory component

## Post-Hackathon Enhancements
- Expand reference database to thousands of songs
- Add melody similarity detection
- Implement user accounts and history
- Mobile app development
- Integration with music production software
